This ontology represents a structured model of museums, their categories, collections, events, staff, and related properties. It includes classifications for different types of museums (e.g., public, private, science museums), relationships between entities (e.g., hasCategory, hasCollection), and example individuals like the MOCA Museum and National Science Museum.

This project is part of my learning and implementation journey in ontology modeling using Protégé. 
I studying and modifying it to better understand OWL, RDF, and semantic web concepts.
